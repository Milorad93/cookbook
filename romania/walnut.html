    <p>There’s something about cookies filled with cream that we all love, right? What’s not to love? These walnut-shaped cookies are a dessert that we prefer to make during the holiday season, for Easter or Christmas… that’s because it requires a bit of time and patience to make them.</p>
    <p>These cookies, which are actually shaped like real walnuts, must be prepared with a special cookie mold. I know that these cookies were originally prepared in Russia, so you could have a chance to get it at a Russian food shop or online by searching for walnut-shaped cookie mould </p>
    <p>The cookie “shells” are not soft and cakey, they’re really firm once you bake them. After filling them with cream, it’s best to let them sit in an air-tight container for at least one day, so the cookie shells get a chance to absorb the moisture and to become softer. This is a good reason to prepare the cookies a few days before serving them.</p> 
    <p>Now, the cream. The cream is a heavenly mixture between simple ingredients: cookie shell trimmings, walnuts, cocoa, sugar, milk, butter and a bit of rum essence. The cookie trimmings give the filling an interesting texture and keeps it firm enough to not drip excessively from the cookies once you fill them.</p>

    <ul><h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>For the shells</h3>
    <li>600 g flour</li>
    <li>10 g baking powder</li>
    <li>250 g butter at room temperature</li>
    <li>100 g powdered (icing) sugar</li>
    <li>4 eggs</li>
        <h3>For the cream</h3>
    <li>Cookie trimmings that remain after baking the cookie shells</li>
    <li>200 g butter at room temperature</li>
    <li>200 g sugar</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons cocoa</li>
    <li>200 g shredded walnuts</li>
    <li>A bit of rum essence/aroma</li>
    <li>Extra powdered sugar for dusting the cookies</li>
     
</ul>
    <ol><h2>Mode of preparation</h2>
        <h3>For the shells</h3>
        <li>Start by mixing the softened butter (at room temperature) with the powdered sugar for 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs, one by one, mixing after each one until it’s fully incorporated.</li>
        <li>Add the salt and baking powder to the flour and add one tablespoon at a time to the wet ingredients. Keep buy synthroid canada adding flour until you get a soft dough.</li>
        <li>Place the dough on a working surface and knead it until it’s smooth.</li>
        <li>Start forming small dough balls using your hands. Use a kitchen scale to weigh the dough balls. Each one should weigh approximately 5 grams.</li>
        <li>Preheat the cookie mold directly on your stove. Brush it with a bit of oil for the first time, to keep the dough balls from sticking to it. Add one dough ball in each hollowed-out hole of one plate of the cookie mold. The dough should cover only about 1/3 of each hole. Press the other plate on top and place the mold on the stove over medium heat. Press the handles and cook the dough for about 2 minutes, checking them after 1 minute. The outside of the shells should be golden when they’re done. I used a knife to easily transfer the cookie shells to a cooling rack.</li>
        <li>Proceed baking the remaining dough until it’s all used up. Let the cookie shells cool completely before filling them.</li>
        <li>With a small knife, gently remove the excess edges of the shells, making sure you don’t crack them – they tend to be really fragile.</li>
     </ol><ol>
        <h3>For the cream</h3>
        <li>Mix the butter with the sugar until it’s creamy.</li>
        <li>Mix in the cocoa and the rum essence.</li>
        <li>Add the nuts, the cookie trimmings and incorporate them by using a spatula.</li>
        <li>Fill each shell with cream and seal two shells by bringing them together. A bit of cream will drip around the edges. If you wish, remove the excess using your finger.</li>
        <li>You can dust powdered sugar over the walnut cookies.</li>
        <li>That’s it! You can store the cookies in an airtight container for up to 7 days, in a cool room or in the fridge.</li>
