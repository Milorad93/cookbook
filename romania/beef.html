    <p>When it comes to eating and preparing meat, I can easily say that I usually prefer chicken, turkey or fish. I’m not really a fan of pork, but, from time to time, I enjoy eating some beef. The only problem with beef is that you really need to know how to cook it, so that it won’t turn out incredibly tough. I admit that I am not an expert in cooking beef meat, but this recipe (my mom’s, thank you mami) always works.</p>
    <p>I didn’t want to use the ultra-popular potato side dish for my beef steak. That’s why I made this creamy carrot purée, made with carrots, celery root and just a bit of cream. The flavors match perfectly with the meat, and the sweetness of the carrots goes great with the tomato sauce in which the beef was cooked.</p>
    <p>And now, let’s find out how to cook the beef. I prefer to pre-boil the beef before putting it in the oven with the sauce. That’s why I take some time and let the beef boil for at least 2 hours. Make sure you add some spices and an onion to the water in which the beef boils – I added an onion, some black pepper and 2 bay leaves, which always go great with beef.</p> 
    <p>After the meat is cooked through, you just have to make the sauce and put everything in the oven. Don’t throw away the beef stock, because you need to add some to the oven pot. I prepared this beef steak with a light tomato and garlic sauce, but next time, I will definitely try a green pepper sauce. I’ll experiment some more and try to cook the beef order phentermine hcl 37.5 without boiling it first. Until then, I’ll just stick to my favorite recipe.</p>
    <ul><h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Beef steak</h3>
        <li>700 g (1.5 lb) beef meat</li>
        <li>200 ml (7/8 cup) tomato paste</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>4 g (1 teaspoon) sugar</li>
        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>30 ml (2 tablespoons) oil</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <br>
        <h3>Carrot purée</h3>
        <li>3 carrots</li>
         <li>½ celery root</li>
         <li>80 ml (1/3 cup) heavy cream</li>
         <li>Salt and pepper</li>
</ul>
    <ol><h2>Mode of preparation</h2>
     <h3>For the beef steak</h3>
     <li>Fill a medium pot with cold water and add the beef steak cut into thick slices. Boil the beef on medium heat, skimming any foam that rises to the surface.</li>
     <li>When no more foam rises to the surface, add the onion, the pepper and the bay leaves. Leave the beef to cook for at least 1 more hour.</li>
     <li>Meanwhile, make the tomato sauce – mix the tomato paste with the crushed garlic, sugar, salt and pepper to taste and heat the oven to 180°C (360°F).</li>
     <li>When the meat is cooked through, take it out of the stock and put it into an oven-safe pot. Cover the beef in the tomato sauce, then add some beef stock and a bit of oil, without pouring them directly over the steak.</li>
     <li>Cook the meat in the oven for 30 minutes.</li>
     </ol> 
     <ol><h3>For the carrot purée</h3>
        <li>Chop the carrots and the celery into medium pieces, then place them in a saucepan, and cover with water.</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil, and simmer until the carrots and the celery are tender. After 20 minutes of simmering, they should be cooked through.</li>
        <li>Drain the liquid, then use a blender to mash the carrots and the celery, until the purée is smooth.</li>
        <li>Add the heavy cream, salt and pepper, and mix them in the purée with a whisk.</li>
     </ol>
